> hi i'm brann, a software engineer specializing in backend development and web development. i'm serbian and i'm quite a patriot. i love coding, i started around 3-4 years ago but i really got into it around 1-2 years ago. my main focus is python and c, but i also like web development using html, css, flask and javascript. in my free time, i like to play cs2 and hang out with friends. i'm always looking to learn new things and improve my skills, so feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat.

some projects i worked on:
